**Overview**

This project builds a deep learning model using MobileNetV2 to recognize food items from images (using Food-101 dataset) and estimate their average calorie content.
The goal is to help users track dietary intake and make informed food choices.

**Objectives**
1. To detect food type by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. To estimate food weight and calories of food

****Data collection** 
For this project I used two datasets:
1. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rmVS_n6P1859trFxKhY7iHVywjTIRYwn?usp=sharing
2. ECUST Food Dataset (ECUSTFD)
In this project I used 7 food items like apple, banana, carrot, cucumber, onion, orange and tomato which details given in table below
